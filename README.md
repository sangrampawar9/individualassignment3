<h1>Individual Assignment 3<h1>

The project consists of making an enclosure using a 3D printer or/and a laser cutter. The enclosure is being made for the previous project (Individual Assignment-2).
In addition to the previous project an OLED is being added as an extra output. The OLED displays the user how close a person/object is to the proximity sensor and also displays a Warning message if the person/object is very close.
Apart from the OLED the project already had a neopixel 24 ring LED which is being used to light up the acrylic box that was made with the Laser printer. It also serves the purpose of conveying the proximity information.
